The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between above two is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
This program intends to find the difference between
the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
